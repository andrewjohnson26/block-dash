# block-dash
This is my final project I made for Carnegie Mellon's 15-112, Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science
The name of my project is Block Dash, in which the player controls a block and must navigate through obstacles such as other blocks, spikes, and portals. The user only needs to run the TP file in VSCode with the leaderboard csv and the audio mp3 downloaded. I am using 112 graphics for this project, and pygame for music
